### Hey there, fellow human! ðŸ‘‹
# I'm dynamyc! Just an another wannabe dev!

### Most of the repos you find on my page are school/learning related, or just forks of other repos that I haven't touched yet. (probably)

## Some notable things:
- I'm studying Computer Science & Engineering at Ã“buda University!
- I was part of G4X group (find that [here](https://github.com/Team-G4/g4x)), but that's on hold right now.
- I co-developed (at launch time) the [Cyberpunk 2077 Performance Patcher](https://github.com/asoji/Cyberpunk2077-PerformancePatcher)! (Works up until 1.04, **NOT 1.4**)
- what is life

I wish to do many other cool things in the future! Though right now I prefer smaller projects, maybe gonna change that later on.
