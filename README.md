### Hey there, fellow human! ðŸ‘‹
# I'm dynamyc! Just an another wannabe dev!

### Mostly vibing, but this README might be abit out of date. Feel free to check out my [website](https://dynamyc.me) for more up-to-date(-ish) information.



## Nonetheless, here are some notable things:
- I'm studying Computer Science & Engineering at Ã“buda University!
- I was part of G4X group (find that [here](https://github.com/Team-G4/g4x)), but that's on hold right now.
- I co-developed (at launch time) the [Cyberpunk 2077 Performance Patcher](https://github.com/asoji/Cyberpunk2077-PerformancePatcher)! (Works up until 1.04, **NOT 1.4**)
- I made [Moodleee](https://github.com/dynamyc010/moodleee), a Discord Bot to gather your information about things you might still need to do.
- I started work on [Neptun PowerUp's](https://github.com/dynamyc010/npu)'s rewrite, for the new modern Neptun system, but due to lack of time and energy, it's been put on hold for now.
- Other smaller contributions all around.
