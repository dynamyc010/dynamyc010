### Most of the repos you find on my page are school/learning related, or just forks of other repos that I haven't touched yet. (probably)

## Some notable things:
- I'm a proud helper on the Dude, Stop Discord server! ([Join!](https://discord.com/invite/SdWBfVS))
-  One of my biggest projects here on GitHub was G4X's Discord Integration that you can find [here](https://github.com/Team-G4/g4x)!
Sadly that project died down, so you won't see anything happening in there. 
- I sometimes make A Hat in Time mods. Tho I'm not known for that.
- what is life
